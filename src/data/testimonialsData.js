      "Over the past two years, I’ve worked with Jack on a handful of very complex and demanding web-development projects – I can honestly say that it has always been a pleasure. He is a stellar front-end developer with an incredible attention to detail, and his deep knowledge of full-stack coding has always impressed me. I know for a fact that the successes of our shared work is largely thanks to Jack’s immense talent, outgoing personality, and willingness to empower his colleagues by sharking knowledge from his robust digital tool belt.",

      "Jack is a hard working dedicated developer who I've had the pleasure to work with for the last year or so. He is keen to help other developers especially sharing his JS knowledge with less experienced team members and he has taken more responsibility in preparing and deploying releases for the wider team. I've been particularly impressed with his push for more unit test code coverage across the team's code base. I like his consideration of the bigger picture during development - thinking about long term maintenance of the code base and offering useful suggestions on how to improve existing code bases. Jack is doing great things, and I'd definitely recommend him for any future role.",
